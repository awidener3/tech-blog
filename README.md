Then, the user should be able to view and create posts, and comment on premade posts.

## üìé How to Use
When the user enters the application, they will be able to view any previously created posts by other members of the app. To access any of the features, the user will be prompted to sign up or login. After creating an account or logging in, they will then be sent to their personal dashboard where they can write a new post or view/edit/delete posts they've previously made.

On the home page, the user can also click on any post which will redirect them to a screen where they can view and create comments on that post.
